# 🫀 Heart Disease Risk Analysis (EDA Project)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset** to identify risk factors contributing to cardiovascular disease.  
This project applies **statistical analysis, visualization, clustering, and dimensionality reduction** to explore patterns in patient health data.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Dataset: **UCI Heart Disease Dataset**  
- Goal: Understand **risk factor distributions** (age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.) and their relationship with heart disease.  
- Techniques: Histograms, KDE plots, Boxplots, Correlation heatmaps, PCA, Clustering, Outlier Detection, Demographic Stratification.  
- Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

## 🔑 Key Features
✔️ **Descriptive Statistics** – summary of patient demographics and health indicators  
✔️ **Risk Factor Distribution** – cholesterol, age, blood pressure, max heart rate  
✔️ **Target vs Features Analysis** – categorical & numerical comparisons with heart disease outcome  
✔️ **Correlation & Heatmaps** – relationships among risk factors  
✔️ **Outlier & Anomaly Detection** – detecting unusual patient values  
✔️ **PCA & Clustering** – dimensionality reduction & patient segmentation  
✔️ **Demographic Stratification** – insights by age groups, gender, chest pain types  
✔️ **Geospatial Visualization (Simulated)** – mapping patients (dummy city data) for visualization practice

**📌 Results & Insights**
Higher **cholesterol** and **resting blood pressure** show increased risk correlation.

**Age** groups 40–60 are most affected.

Patients with **exercise-induced angina** show higher heart disease incidence.

PCA & clustering reveal **clear patient segmentation** based on key risk factors.
